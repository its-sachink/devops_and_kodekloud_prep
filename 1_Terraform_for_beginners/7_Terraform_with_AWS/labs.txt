####### 1 : AWS CLI & IAM #######

Note : As explained in the Lab Demonstration video, we are making use of localstack as the mocking framework to work with AWS.
This framework is exposed at http://aws:4566. Hence, throughout this lab, we will be making use of the command option and parameter like this: --endpoint http://aws:4566


- Create a new user called mary using the AWS CLI.
    Make sure to use the --endpoint http://aws:4566 option with the command.

    # aws --endpoint http://aws:4566 iam create-user --user-name mary


- Now, inspect the newly created user mary and find out its ARN (Amazon Resource Name).

    # aws --endpoint http://aws:4566 iam list-users


- What is the default region that has been configured for use with the AWS CLI?

    # cat /root/.aws/config


- What is the aws_access_key_id used in the configuration?

    # cat /root/.aws/credentials



- Now that we have a few users created, let's grant them privileges.
    Let's start with mary, grant her full administrator access by making use of the policy called AdministratorAccess.

    Make use of the subcommand attach-user-policy.
    
    The ARN of the AdministratorAccess policy is arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess.

    # aws --endpoint http://aws:4566 iam attach-user-policy --user-name mary --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess




- jack and jill are developers and are part of a project called project-sapphire.
    Create a new IAM Group called project-sapphire-developers. Use the subcommand create-group to create the group.

    # aws --endpoint http://aws:4566 iam create-group --group-name project-sapphire-developers


- Add the IAM users called jack and jill, who are developers to the new IAM Group called project-sapphire-developers.
        Use the subcommand add-user-to-group to add users into the group.

    # aws --endpoint http://aws:4566 iam add-user-to-group --user-name jack --group-name project-sapphire-developers

    # aws --endpoint http://aws:4566 iam add-user-to-group --user-name jill --group-name project-sapphire-developers



- What privileges are granted for jack and jill who are part of the group project-sapphire-developers?
        Check for their permissions individually and the ones granted to the group.

    
    # aws --endpoint http://aws:4566 iam list-attached-group-policies --group-name project-sapphire-developers

    # aws --endpoint http://aws:4566 iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name jack



- Both jack and jill need complete access to the EC2 service.
       Attach the AmazonEC2FullAccess policy with the ARN: arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess to the group project-sapphire-developers.

    # aws --endpoint http://aws:4566 iam attach-group-policy --group-name project-sapphire-developers  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2FullAccess
